Hello. I'm a cyber security professional currently working in network defence/blue operations and I'm looking to develop my skills and branch into more offensive/pentesting/red roles.

Over the next few years I'll be learning everything I can and doing many qualifications, documenting my progress here. Hopefully you find it useful.

vel0rum.
