## Beginning - 16/11/20

I decided a while ago that I want to become a pentester and I've developed a little knowledgebase already (nothing fancy, just a bit of coding and network/web stuff). But I've decided to get serious about it.

I'm 25 years old and in a good job at the moment; my role is quite broad but *can* involve information/cyber security at times, mainly blue stuff and nothing too technical. I have to stay in for the next 3 years but I'll definitely want to leave and get a pentesting job after that. 

To that end, I'm going to spend the next three years trying to learn everything I can about pentesting and I'll document the whole thing here. Hopefully by the end this will be something interesting to look back on, and maybe help some other people. I'm sure I'll make mistakes but that's what will make it fun.

### My plan

I think the best place to start is programming/scripting. I already have some experience with C++ and Python, including some big object-oriented projects a few years ago but not much since then. From what I can tell, these are good languages to know as a pentester, so I'll spend the first part of my journey re-learning those.

After that, I think the next best thing to do is to understand Operating Systems. Both in general, and specific ones (windows and linux). This will include learning bash. I'll try to find a sysadmin course somewhere. I've seen a couple floating about but they're far too expensive. 

Having a good coding background as well as in depth knowledge of windows and linux operating systems would be a great start. I already have a pretty good understanding of networks but that *would* be the next logical point to revise.

I've already bought eLearnSecurity's Penetration Testing Student course so I'll do that early next year to put into practise everything I will have already learned. 

Then we'll go from there, I should have a pretty strong base to expand by that point and I may want to go deeper into web or network systems. (I don't know yet whether it's worth learning things like JavaScript, PHP or HTML but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

By the end of the three years I want to be well prepared for a pentesting career, with several qualifications and a good technical skillset. Like I said earlier, I'll document everything here, mostly for me to read but maybe someday someone else will too.

Edit: INE is releasing their cyber security pass at 40% off this week. It's normally $2k but now it's $1.2 = Â£900. This is a great deal so I'm going to get it. I'll just use the money I saved from not going on holidays this year thanks to COVID. This pass includes courses for both Blue and Red Teaming, beginners all they way up to advanced. I'll learn as much as I can and then take the exams and get the qualifications for the ones I think are important/relevant to my interests.
